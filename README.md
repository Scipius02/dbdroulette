# dbdroulette

A simple webapp to roll your perks in DBD to minimise the number of dead hard users out there.

## Description

Dbdroulette is intended to be used by survivors who care about killers' feelings while granting you the power
to maintain a small amount of agency over the cohesion in your perk kit. I personally don't care for pure
randomizers that leave you with an awkward "No Mither", "Self-Care", "Inner Strength", "Autodidact" build,
so here's a way to have fun while not flying functionally perkless.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Built in vue and currently client side with webp images. This means if you have an older version of Safari or
Edge, you will not see the images.

### Installing

Currently not hosted anywhere, but you can fork and clone this rep to run client side on your computer.
You will additionally need some dependencies, so run 'npm install', then run 'npm run dev' to open this
in a localhost browser.

### Executing program

Instructions are given by the program itself.
